1  	* A number = sum of method(s) to run: LD(=1), Het(=2), Coan(=4), Temporal(=8).
./bernd_Ne/Neest/ 	* Input Directory
sim11.gen 	* Input file name
2 			* 1 = FSTAT format, 2 = GENEPOP format
./bernd_Ne/Neest/ 	* Output Directory
simtestLD.txt 	* Output file name (put asterisk adjacent to the name to append)
3 			* Number of critical values, added 1 if a run by rejecting only singleton alleles is included
0.0  0.05  0.01  -1  	* Critical values, a special value '1' is for rejecting only singleton alleles
0 		* 0: Random mating, 1: Monogamy (LD method)

* Input/Output directories should be ended by a separator: '\'.
  If the directory contains the executable Ne2-1, it may be left empty.

* An asterisk after a blank may be used to signal the end of data
  on the line. It is not required.

* Line 1 may contain 2 entries n, k, where n is for which methods.
  If n < 8, then no Temporal method, and k is ignored if entered.
  If n >= 8, then k is to limit temporal to one or more of the 3 methods,
  by taking the sum
	Pollak = 1, Nei/Tajima = 2, Jorde/Ryman = 4.
  	(May enter k = 0 for all temporal methods.)

* Line 7 contains n = number of positive critical values to be read.
  If only Molecular Coancestry (4 on line 1), then n must be 0.
  If n > 0, the next line should contain n positive critical values.
  A special critical value, '1', is not the actual value,
  but to indicate a run where only singleton alleles are rejected.
  Critical value 0 (no restriction) is automatically added, unless
  a negative value is entered after the last value. If a negative is inserted
  before the last value, then entries for critical values end there.
  The same effect if an asterisk is put immediately after the last value.

* Generations (excluding entry N) should be given in ascending order.
  If not, an asterisk should be put adjacent to the last entry.
